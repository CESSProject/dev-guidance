# Pull Request Template

Using a pull request template (commonly referred to as a "PR template") can help maintainers standardize the initial content included when creating a PR.

Refer to the official documentation [Creating a pull request template for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) for more details.

## Why Use It

It helps submitters organize their thoughts and reduces communication costs between reviewers and submitters.

## How to Use It

There are two ways to enable a PR template:

1. Add a file named `pull_request_template.md` in the `.github/` directory at the root of the repository.
2. Add a set of `.md` files in the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` directory at the root of the repository.

Compared to [issue templates](./issue-template.md), PR templates are much simpler in format, consisting of just a markdown file.
